It assumes that you have enabled side-loading of Microsoft Teams apps in Microsoft Teams as well as have installed all the prerequisites . Generate your project \u00b6 In a command prompt create a new folder called my-connector where you will have your project files. Run the yo teams command to start the generation of the project. Follow the instructions and choose the solution name, title and company name of your app. When asked for a manifest version choose version 1.5 . At the selection of what items you want to use for your project, unselect A Tab and select only A Connector and press Enter . The generator will ask you a few other questions, such as the URL and if you want to include testing and telemetry - choose default value for the URL and opt-out of both testing and telemetry (answer no). When asked what type of Connector you would like to use, choose A new Connector hosted in this solution . Following this you will be asked for a Connector Id, choose the default value by pressing Enter . We will update this value later. Finally you will be asked for the name of your Connector, specify the name that you would like to be shown in Microsoft Teams. For this tutorial you can use My Connector . Once this is done the generator will create all necessary files and install the required npm packages. Register a Connector in the Connector Portal \u00b6 Next step is to register a Connector in the Outlook Connector portal. You will have all the details in the README file that has been generated by the project ( ./README-myConnector.md ). Open a web browser and navigate to https://outlook.office.com/connectors/publish . You have to be an Office 365 admin to be able to do this. Click on New Connector to create and register the Connector, and the fill in information as follows: NOTE: we will use XXX.ngrok.io as a temporary URL, and replace that later, so we can get the ID of the Connector Connector name - the name of your Connector ( My Connector ) Logo - you have to upload a logo Short description - a short description of your connector Detailed description - a longer more detailed description Company website - the URL of your public web site ( https://XXX.ngrok.io ) Configuration page for your Connector - the configuration page ( https://XXX.ngrok.io/myConnector/config.html ) Valid domains - all domains used by your connector ( https://XXX.ngrok.io/ ) Do you wnat to enable actions on your Connector cards - select Yes Actions URL - the URL to be used for actions ( https://XXX.ngrok.io/api/connector ) I accept the terms and conditions... - check this When done press select Save . To get the ID of your Connector you can copy it from the URL, or choose to download the Teams manifest, using the button on the right. NOTE: you have to register your Connector in the same tenant as you are going to test the Connector. If not, you have to go through Publishing the Connector to the store - making it public. Update your project \u00b6 Open up your project by typing code . (assuming you are using Visual Studio code) in the folder where you created your project. Open the .env file and locate the CONNECTOR_ID token. Replace the empty GUID with the Connector ID you copied from the Connector portal and save the file. . Start the application locally \u00b6 Execute the gulp ngrok-serve command in the folder where your project was created. This will create an ngrok tunnel to your local machine, and dynamically generate a public URL for your project. When the command is starting you will see the temporary ngrok host name listed. . Copy the host name and return to the Connector portal and replace the XXX.ngrok.io with the real generated host name. NOTE: Since this is a temporary and dynamic URL you need to update the Connector portal each and every time you start ngrok-serve . It is recommended to use fixed ngrok names (a paid service) or to publish your application to a well-known host. Also be aware that when you change the URL it might take some time for the changes to reflect. . Side load the application \u00b6 Open up Microsoft Teams and create a new Team. Click on the Teams name and select Apps to side load your application. In the lower right corner select Upload a custom app and then browse to your project folder and the subfolder called package and locate the my-connector.zip file. Select the file and choose to upload it. Go to the General channel and click on ... > Connectors . Scroll all the way down to the end, and you will see your custom connector. Click on Configure . . The configuration interface is being loaded and you are asked to choose a color, notice how the Save button is being enabled and then finally and then click Save . You have now configured your custom connector and you can close the Connectors modal dialog. Test the connector \u00b6 When the project was generated a test end-point for your connector was created.

NOTE: Not updated with version 3.0.0 changes This tutorial will take you through the necessary steps and configuration that you need to to in Azure Active Directory and in Microsoft Teams in order to create a Microsoft Teams Tab single-sign-on experience. Preparations \u00b6 Before you start configuring and scaffolding your project you need to ensure that decide on where you want to host your Microsoft Teams tab. A Tab is a web page hosted somewhere and it has to be hosted on a publicly available web site. To be able to support the Tab SSO features your Tab also has to be hosted on a well-known address, such as https://myteamsapp.com/tab.html . The important thing here is that the domain name can't change and you are not allowed to use any web site hosted on azurewebsites.net (due to security constraints). For this tutorial we will take advantage of the paid service ngrok service which allows us to proxy the HTTP calls from a well-known publicly available domain to our local server. However this is not for production builds, but the concept is the same. Set up your Azure AD application \u00b6 The first thing that we need to do is to register a new Azure Active Directory application in the Azure AD portal, that will represent your Microsoft Teams tab. You do this by signing in to https://aad.portal.azure.com using a set of credentials that is allowed to register new applications. Then navigate to Azure Active Directory and chose App Registrations in the left hand side menu. Create a new application by clicking on + New registration - on this first screen you choose the name of your application and also what account types you would like to support - choose any of the Account sin any organizational directory... options. Finally click on Register . After the registration you will be redirected to the Application page where you can find the Application (client) ID , copy this ID into a temporary location such as notepad as you will need it shortly. The next thing we need to do is to go to Expose an API and then on Application ID URI click on Set . This will allow you to configure the Application ID URI which is one of the key configurations of your SSO Tab. The Application ID URI MUST have the following format: api://<your host name>/<application id> . That is you need to use the fully qualified domain name you prepared for your tab together with the Application/Client ID to construct that Application ID URI. Microsoft Teams will verify this at runtime, so you MUST use your domain name in the App ID URI. If you're using test, stage and production environments you should create different Azure AD Applications for them - as an Azure AD App can only have one Application ID URI. Once set you should store this App ID URI, together with the Client ID - as we will need them when scaffolding our project later. Next step is to expose a Scope and you create it by clicking at Add a scope . Name it access_as_user and choose that both Admins and users can consent. Then you need to write the user friendly consent display names and descriptions before clicking Add scope . 1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264 - the ID used by the Microsoft Teams desktop and mobile application 5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346 - the ID use by the Microsoft Teams web application The final configuration we need to do is to grant permissions to the Tab App registration. This is done by navigating to API Permissions and then click on Add a permission . All the permissions we need is in Microsoft Graph , so select that and then we also need to choose that we want to use Delegated Permissions . The permissions you need to select are the following: User.Read - should already be selected when the app was created email offline_access openid profile That's it! Now we are ready to scaffold out our Teams Tab project. Generate your project \u00b6 Start the Microsoft Teams App generator by invoking the yo teams command. Follow the instructions and input name of your solution and package. Choose a schema version that is 1.5 or higher and then select to create a Tab . When asked about the URL where you will host this solution insert the exact URL you used when configuring the Application ID URI previously. Note: we can change this at a later stage by modifying the .env file. Optionally add support for testing and application insights. Choose your name for the Tab and then choose to create a Configurable tab and choose the default options for the rest until you get to the Do you required Azure AD Single-Sign-On support for the Tab? then choose Yes . You will now be asked first for the Application ID and then the Application ID URI that was generated when you registered the App. If you don't remember them or forgot to take a note of them - these values are always available fromt the Application registration summary page. Finally opt-out of enabling the SharePoint Online integration by selecting No, and then wait for the project to scaffold and to install all npm packages. Inspect the generated code \u00b6 Open up the generated project in your favorite code editor and open the manifest file ( ./src/manifest/manifest.json ) and scroll down to the last few lines. You will see an addition of a new configuration there - which tells Teams that we want to use Single-Sign-On using the specified Azure AD application. \"webApplicationInfo\" : { \"id\" : \"{{SSODEMO_APP_ID}}\" , \"resource\" : \"{{SSODEMO_APP_URI}}\" } NOTE: as usual the replaceable parameters can be found in the .env file. The actual tab page is found under ./src/app/scripts/<your tab name>/<your tab name>.tsx . If you inspect this React based page you will notice that the default generated code uses the microsoftTeams.authentication.getAuthToken() to retrive a token when the page is loaded. If all is configured correctly this will return an identity token that can be used to validate the user and in the default case displaying the name of the user. NOTE: this token can not be used to retrieve information from for instance Microsoft Graph. In order to do so you need to implement server side support for the Azure AD on-behalf-of flow to exchange this identity token for another token. Run the application using ngrok-serve \u00b6 In this demo we decided to use ngrok to create a publicly available domain and before running the Teams app we need to configure ngrok by registering the domain we specified previously - and then update the .env file with the ngrok subdomain as well as the ngrok auth key. NOTE: this registration of domains requires a paid subscription to ngrok. If you're using the free version you have to start the application using gulp ngrok-serve and then use the temporary domain name and update your Azure AD app registration with that. To start the application and to generate the manifest run gulp ngrok-serve in the command prompt. Once the command line shows that the application is up and running you can continue with side loading the application into a newly create Microsoft Teams team. Sideload and test the application \u00b6 Go to the Team where you want to test the application, hover over the Team icon/log and choose the Apps icon. In the lower right hand corner choose to Upload a custom app and choose the packaged manifest that was generated ( ./package/<manifest>.zip ), and then click Add to finalize the side loading. Go to a channel in your Team and choose to add a new Tab. You will find your application amongst the available tabs, choose it and follow the instructions to configure it and then click Add . The Tab will now be loaded and within a few seconds you will see that the Tab will write out your name - that it retrieved from the identity token and it shows that everything is working as expected.","title":"Build a tab with SSO"},{"location":"tutorials/build-a-tab-with-sso-support/#build-a-tab-with-single-sign-on-support","text":"NOTE: required generator-teams version 2.13.0 or higher.

In this tutorial we will walk through creating your very first Microsoft Teams app using the Microsoft Teams Yeoman generator. It assumes that you have enabled side-loading of Microsoft Teams apps in Microsoft Teams as well as have installed all the prerequisites . Generate your project \u00b6 Open up a command prompt and create a new directory where you want to create your project and in that directory type the command yo teams . This will start the Teams Apps generator and you will be asked a set of questions. The first question is about your project name, you can leave it as is by pressing enter. Next question asks you if you want to create a new directory or use the current one. As we already are in the directory we want, we just press enter. The following step asks for a title of your project, this title will be used in the manifest and description of your app. And then you will be asked for a company name, which also will be used in the manifest. The fifth question asks you about what version of the manifest you want to use. For this tutorial select v1.8 , which is the current general available schema. The next question asks you if you want to use Quick scaffolding - if you choose Yes a fewer set of questions will be asked and if you choose No a more advanced set of questions will follow. Choose yes for this tutorial. After this the generator will ask you for what items you want to add to your project. You can select a single one or any combination of items. For now, just select a Tab . Based on what items you select, you will be asked a set of follow-up questions. Now you need to enter a URL of where you will host your solution. This can be any URL, but by default the generator suggests an Azure Web Sites URL. The generator has a lot of built-in advanced features that you can opt-in or opt-out of, also based on your Quick scaffolding choice. For this tutorial choose the default options, except when being asked about support for single-sign-on . Once all questions is answered the generator will scaffold the required files and finally install all the npm packages. This will take a minute or two. Add some code to your tab \u00b6 Once the generator is done you can open up the solution in your favorite code editor.

Yo Teams rocks ! < /div> < /Flex.Item> Save the file and return to the command prompt. Build your app \u00b6 You can now build your project. This is done in two steps (or one step, see below). First you need to create the Teams App manifest file, that you upload/sideload into Microsoft Teams. This is done by the Gulp task gulp manifest . This will validate the manifest and create a zip file in the ./package directory. To build your solution you use the gulp build command. This will transpile your solution into the ./dist folder. Run your app \u00b6 To run your app you use the gulp serve command. This will build and start a local web server for you to test your app. The command will also rebuild the application whenever you save a file in your project. You should now be able to browse to http://localhost:3007/helloWorldTab/ to ensure that your tab is rendering. However, not in Microsoft Teams yet. Run your app in Microsoft Teams \u00b6 Microsoft Teams does not allow you to have your app hosted on localhost, so you need to either publish it to a public URL or use a proxy such as ngrok. Good news is that the scaffolded project has this built-in. When you run gulp ngrok-serve the ngrok service will be started in the background, with a unique and public DNS entry and it will also package the manifest with that unique URL and then do the exact same thing as gulp serve . After running gulp ngrok-serve , create a new Microsoft Teams team and when it is created click on the Team name, to go to the teams settings and then select Apps . In the lower right corner you should see a link Upload a custom app , select it and then browse to your project folder and the subfolder called package . Select the zip file in that folder and choose open. Your App is now sideloaded into Microsoft Teams. Go back to the General channel and select + to add a new Tab. You should see your tab in the list of tabs. Choose your tab and follow the instructions to add it. Notice that you have a custom configuration dialog, for which you can edit the source. Select Save to add your tab to the channel. Once done your tab should be loaded inside Microsoft Teams! Congrats!

This will start the Teams Apps generator and you will be asked a set of questions. The first question is about your project name, you can leave it as is by pressing enter. Next question asks you if you want to create a new directory or use the current one. As we already are in the directory we want, we just press enter. The following step asks for a title of your project, this title will be used in the manifest and description of your app. And then you will be asked for a company name, which also will be used in the manifest. The fifth question asks you about what version of the manifest you want to use. For this tutorial select v1.8 , which is the current general available schema. The next question asks you if you want to use Quick scaffolding - if you choose Yes a fewer set of questions will be asked and if you choose No a more advanced set of questions will follow. Choose yes for this tutorial. After this the generator will ask you for what items you want to add to your project. You can select a single one or any combination of items. For now, just select a Tab . Based on what items you select, you will be asked a set of follow-up questions. Now you need to enter a URL of where you will host your solution. This can be any URL, but by default the generator suggests an Azure Web Sites URL. The generator has a lot of built-in advanced features that you can opt-in or opt-out of, also based on your Quick scaffolding choice. For this tutorial choose the default options, except when being asked about support for single-sign-on . Once all questions is answered the generator will scaffold the required files and finally install all the npm packages.
